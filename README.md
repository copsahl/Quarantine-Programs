# Quarantine-Programs
Collection of programs I write out of boredom during this trying time.

## Compliment Generator
Sets up a listening socket on port 1337, someone connects and it spits them out a compliment. (Made to entertain my girlfriend Part I)

## Remote Madlibs
Let a friend connect to your device and have fun doing random madlibs. (Made to entertain my girlfriend Part II)
