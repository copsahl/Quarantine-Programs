An amusement park is always fun to visit on a hot summer dog
 when you get there, you can wear your the left sock
 and go for a swim. And there are lots of fuzzy
 things to eat. You can start off with a/an obnoxious
-dog on a/an tree
 with mustard, relish, and potatoes
 on it. Then you can have a buttered ear of water bottle
 with a nice happy
 slice of fries
 and a big bottle of cold sprite
. When you are full, it's time to go on the roller coaster, which should settle your knee cap
. Other amusement park rides are the bumper cars, which have little blankets
 that you drive and run into other leaves
, and the merry-go-round, where you can sit on a big squirrel
 and try to grab the gold coaster
 as you ride past it.


An amusement park is always fun to visit on a hot summer shoe
 when you get there, you can wear your scarf
 and go for a swim. And there are lots of blue
 things to eat. You can start off with a/an round
-dog on a/an desk
 with mustard, relish, and humans
 on it. Then you can have a buttered ear of lamp
 with a nice wild
 slice of tacos
 and a big bottle of cold maple syrup
. When you are full, it's time to go on the roller coaster, which should settle your left ear lobe
. Other amusement park rides are the bumper cars, which have little hats
 that you drive and run into other guns
, and the merry-go-round, where you can sit on a big manatee
 and try to grab the gold mop
 as you ride past it.
