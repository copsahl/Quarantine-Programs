1. Dear NAME_OF_PERSON, I love your ADJECTIVE face! Your hair is like a flock of ANIMAL_PLURAL! I love the way your NOUN smells! You make me grow more in EMOTION with you every NOUN! I hope you get this letter! You're my TYPE_OF_FOOD queen! Love you! Sincerely, NAME_OF_PERSON!
2. An amusement park is always fun to visit on a hot summer NOUN when you get there, you can wear your ARTICLE_OF_CLOTHING and go for a swim. And there are lots of ADJECTIVE things to eat. You can start off with a/an ADJECTIVE-dog on a/an NOUN with mustard, relish, and PLURAL_NOUN on it. Then you can have a buttered ear of NOUN with a nice ADJECTIVE slice of TYPE_OF_FOOD and a big bottle of cold TYPE_OF_LIQUID. When you are full, it's time to go on the roller coaster, which should settle your PART_OF_THE_BODY. Other amusement park rides are the bumper cars, which have little PLURAL_NOUN that you drive and run into other PLURAL_NOUN, and the merry-go-round, where you can sit on a big ANIMAL and try to grab the gold NOUN as you ride past it.
